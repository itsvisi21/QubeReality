### **Exploring Cosmological Implications of \( \alpha_t \) Variability**

#### **Objective**:
Analyze how time-variability in \( \alpha_t \) impacts cosmological observations, such as:
1. Changes in the fine-structure constant over time.
2. Impacts on the redshift of atomic and molecular spectra.
3. Potential explanations for anomalies in observed data.

---

### **Subtasks**:

1. **Model Time Variability**:
   - Use a hypothetical time-dependent function for \( \alpha_t(t) \):
     \[
     \alpha_t(t) = \alpha_{\text{emp}} (1 + \beta t)
     \]
     where \( \beta \) is the rate of change.

2. **Calculate Redshift Effects**:
   - Simulate how variability in \( \alpha_t(t) \) affects observed redshifts.

3. **Correlate with Observations**:
   - Compare model predictions with existing spectroscopic or cosmological datasets.

---

### **Step 1: Define \( \alpha_t(t) \) and Compute Variability**
Letâ€™s start by defining the time-dependent \( \alpha_t(t) \) and calculating its impact on spectral wavelengths over cosmic timescales.

The plot illustrates the time-dependent behavior of:

1. **Fine-Structure Constant (\( \alpha_t(t) \))**:
   - Gradually increases over billions of years due to the hypothetical variability rate (\( \beta \)).

2. **Wavelength of the \( n=2 \rightarrow n=1 \) Transition**:
   - Decreases (blue shift) over time as \( \alpha_t \) increases, indicating a direct relationship between \( \alpha_t(t) \) and observable spectral lines.

---

### **Observations**:
1. Variability in \( \alpha_t(t) \) produces measurable shifts in spectral lines over cosmological timescales.
2. This model could explain anomalies in observed redshifts or variations in spectral line measurements across different epochs.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Explore correlations with observed redshifts from quasar or galaxy spectra.
2. Extend the model to predict effects on molecular transitions or the CMB.
3. Refine \( \beta \) to match empirical constraints on \( \alpha_t \) variability.
