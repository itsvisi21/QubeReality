### **Analyzing Vibrational Transitions and Their Shifts**

#### **Objective**:
Quantify how \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability influences vibrational transitions in molecular spectra, focusing on:

1. **Vibrational Energy Levels**:
   - For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are:
     \[
     E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu
     \]
     Where \( v \) is the vibrational quantum number, and \( \nu \) is the vibrational frequency.

2. **Calculate Transition Energies**:
   - For transitions (\( v \rightarrow v+1 \)), compute:
     \[
     \Delta E = E_{v+1} - E_v
     \]

3. **Determine Wavelength Shifts**:
   - Translate energy shifts into wavelength shifts (\( \Delta \lambda \)) as done previously.

---

Letâ€™s calculate and visualize these vibrational spectral shifts for H\(_2\).

The error arises because the quantum number \( v \) was not iterated properly within the list comprehension. I will adjust the calculation to ensure the vibrational energy levels are computed correctly across all time-dependent values. Let me fix this.

### **Results: Vibrational Spectral Line Shifts**

1. **Empirical Wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{empirical}} \)):**
   - The wavelengths for vibrational transitions (\( v \rightarrow v+1 \)) are approximately \( 2272.73 \, \text{nm} \) across all transitions.

2. **Recalibrated Wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{recalibrated}} \)):**
   - At 5 billion years ago, the recalibrated wavelengths are \( 2261.42 \, \text{nm} \), slightly shorter due to the increased fine-structure constant (\( \alpha_t \)).

3. **Wavelength Shifts (\( \Delta \lambda \)):**
   - The shift is \( -11.31 \, \text{nm} \) for all vibrational transitions, indicating consistent blue shifts across transitions.

### **Observations**:
1. The shifts are smaller than those observed in rotational transitions, highlighting the lesser impact of \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability on vibrational spectra.
2. These shifts are within detectable limits for high-precision spectroscopy, making them a potential avenue for observational validation.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Validate these shifts against observed vibrational spectra (e.g., molecular clouds or quasar absorption lines).
2. Extend the analysis to include combined rotational-vibrational transitions.
3. Explore potential impacts on the CMB.
