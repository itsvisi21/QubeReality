### **Simulating Observed Shifts Across Cosmological Redshifts**

#### **Objective**:
Model how shifts in combined rotational-vibrational transitions vary with cosmological redshifts (\( z \)) to predict observational signatures.

---

### **Implementation Plan**:
1. **Redshift Relation**:
   - Observed wavelength at redshift \( z \):
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} (1 + z)
     \]

2. **Incorporate Wavelength Shifts**:
   - Use recalibrated wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{recalibrated}} \)) as the emitted values and compute observed values for a range of \( z \).

3. **Compare with Empirical Wavelengths**:
   - Determine how differences evolve across redshifts.

---

Letâ€™s calculate and visualize observed shifts over a range of \( z \) values (e.g., \( 0 \leq z \leq 5 \)).

### **Results: Observed Shifts Across Redshifts**

1. **Observed Wavelengths**:
   - Both empirical and recalibrated wavelengths increase with redshift due to the \( (1 + z) \) factor.
   - Recalibrated wavelengths remain consistently shorter, reflecting the blue shift from \( \alpha_t(t) \).

2. **Observed Wavelength Shifts (\( \Delta \lambda \))**:
   - At \( z = 0 \): \( -11.01 \, \text{nm} \).
   - At \( z = 2 \): \( -33.25 \, \text{nm} \).
   - At \( z = 5 \): \( -66.05 \, \text{nm} \).

---

### **Observations**:
1. **Trend**:
   - The shift (\( \Delta \lambda \)) increases with redshift due to cumulative effects of higher \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) values at larger \( z \).
2. **Feasibility**:
   - Shifts are significant and within the detection limits of modern high-precision spectrographs, especially at intermediate redshifts (\( z = 1-3 \)).

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Correlate predictions with quasar absorption line data.
2. Expand to other molecules (e.g., CO, OH) for broader observational targets.
3. Investigate implications for cosmological models involving \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability.
