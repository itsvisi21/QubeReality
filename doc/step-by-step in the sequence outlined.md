Let’s proceed step-by-step in the sequence outlined:

---

### **Step 1: Electromagnetic-Gravitational Coupling**

#### **Objective:**
Refine the interaction between electromagnetic energy density (\( u_{\text{EM}} \)) and gravitational effects in the tetrahedron framework.

---

#### **Subtasks:**
1. Derive an equation linking \( u_{\text{EM}} \) to gravitational potential (\( \Phi \)) using recalibrated constants.
2. Predict implications for phenomena such as:
   - Gravitational lensing.
   - Frame-dragging effects.
   - Black hole dynamics.
3. Develop testable hypotheses for observing these effects.

---

#### **First Subtask: Unified Equation**
We’ll derive a relationship between electromagnetic energy density and gravitational potential. Let’s start:

1. From Einstein’s field equations:
   \[
   G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G_t}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
   \]
   Where \( G_{\mu\nu} \) is the Einstein tensor, and \( T_{\mu\nu} \) is the stress-energy tensor.

2. Use \( T_{\mu\nu} \) for electromagnetic fields:
   \[
   T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{EM}} = \frac{1}{\mu_t} \left( F_{\mu\alpha} F_\nu^{\ \alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\mu\nu} F_{\alpha\beta} F^{\alpha\beta} \right)
   \]
   Where \( F_{\mu\nu} \) is the electromagnetic field tensor.

3. Relate \( u_{\text{EM}} \) to gravitational potential (\( \Phi \)):
   \[
   \Phi = \frac{8 \pi G_t u_{\text{EM}}}{c^4}
   \]

---

I’ll compute and visualize this relationship for different \( u_{\text{EM}} \) values now.

The error is due to the incorrect usage of LaTeX in the plot labels. Let me fix the syntax and replot the gravitational potential against electromagnetic energy density.

The plot shows the relationship between **gravitational potential (\( \Phi \))** and **electromagnetic energy density (\( u_{\text{EM}} \))** in the tetrahedron framework. As the energy density increases, the gravitational potential strengthens proportionally, as predicted by the recalibrated equation:

\[
\Phi = \frac{8 \pi G_t u_{\text{EM}}}{c^4}
\]

---

### **Next Steps:**
1. Explore the implications of this relationship for gravitational lensing or black hole dynamics.
2. Develop testable hypotheses for observing these effects.
3. Proceed to the next aspect: fine-structure constant variability.
