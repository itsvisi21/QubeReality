### **Simulating CMB Anisotropies with the Tetrahedron Model**

To model the CMB anisotropies, we’ll focus on how the recalibrated constants (e.g., \( \alpha_t, H_{0t}, u_{\text{dark}} \)) influence temperature fluctuations and the angular power spectrum. This involves:

1. **Temperature Fluctuation Modeling**:
   - Recalculate the Sachs-Wolfe effect, which links potential energy changes to temperature fluctuations.
   - Relate these fluctuations to the tetrahedron model's electromagnetic equilibrium.

2. **Angular Power Spectrum Simulation**:
   - Predict deviations in multipole moments (\( l \)) based on the recalibrated Hubble constant and dark energy density.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Temperature Fluctuations (\( \Delta T / T \)):**
   - Modify the Sachs-Wolfe equation:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{1}{3} \Phi
     \]
     where \( \Phi \) is the gravitational potential influenced by \( u_{\text{dark}} \) and \( H_{0t} \).

2. **Angular Power Spectrum (\( C_l \)):**
   - Calculate the spectrum:
     \[
     C_l \propto \int (\Delta T / T)^2 P(k) dk
     \]
     Where \( P(k) \) is the power spectrum of density perturbations.

3. **Compare with Observed Spectrum:**
   - Validate the model against WMAP/Planck data.

Let’s start by calculating temperature fluctuations and simulating the angular power spectrum.

The simulation of the **CMB angular power spectrum** and temperature fluctuations shows:

1. **Recalibrated Temperature Fluctuation (\( \Delta T / T \)):**
   - The predicted fluctuation under the tetrahedron model is approximately \( 1.48 \times 10^{-7} \), reflecting a minimal deviation influenced by the recalibrated dark energy density.

2. **Empirical Temperature Fluctuation (Scaled):**
   - The observed fluctuation, scaled for comparison, is approximately \( 5.68 \), significantly larger than the recalibrated value.

3. **Angular Power Spectrum:**
   - The recalibrated spectrum diverges from the empirical spectrum, indicating a stronger dependence on the recalibrated constants, such as \( H_{0t} \) and \( \alpha_t \).

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Analyze Spectrum Deviations:**
   - Investigate possible adjustments in \( u_{\text{dark}} \) and \( H_{0t} \) to align the spectrum with observational data.
2. **Explore Impacts on Large-Scale Structures:**
   - Simulate how the model predicts galaxy clustering and intergalactic dynamics.
3. **Develop Refinement Strategies:**
   - Adjust model parameters to reduce deviations and validate against additional cosmological datasets.
