### **Step 4: Extending Analysis to Molecular Transitions and CMB Effects**

#### **Objective**:
Explore how the variability in \( \alpha_t \) impacts:
1. **Molecular Transitions**:
   - Changes in rotational and vibrational spectra of molecules.
2. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**:
   - Shifts in anisotropies or spectral distortions.

---

### **Subtasks**:

1. **Model Molecular Transition Effects**:
   - Focus on diatomic molecules like H\(_2\) or CO.
   - Use rotational energy levels:
     \[
     E_J = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} J(J + 1)
     \]
     Where \( I \) is the moment of inertia, and relate it to \( \alpha_t \).

2. **Analyze CMB Distortions**:
   - Predict how changes in \( \alpha_t \) affect CMB anisotropies:
     \[
     \Delta T / T \propto \alpha_t(t)^n
     \]
     For a suitable power \( n \).

Letâ€™s start with molecular transitions, calculating how \( \alpha_t(t) \) influences rotational spectra of diatomic hydrogen (H\(_2\)).

The error arises because the quantum number \( J \) in the recalibrated energy calculation is undefined within the list comprehension. I will fix this by iterating over both \( J \) levels and \( \alpha_t(t) \) values to calculate the recalibrated rotational energy levels properly. Let me correct this and replot.

The plot compares the rotational energy levels of diatomic hydrogen (H\(_2\)):

1. **Empirical Energy Levels**:
   - Based on the fixed fine-structure constant (\( \alpha_{\text{emp}} \)), the levels increase quadratically with the quantum number \( J \).

2. **Recalibrated Energy Levels**:
   - At 5 billion years ago (\( t = 5 \, \text{Gyr} \)), the energy levels are slightly shifted due to the time-dependent fine-structure constant (\( \alpha_t \)).

---

### **Observations**:
1. The recalibrated energy levels are consistently higher than the empirical ones, reflecting the increase in \( \alpha_t(t) \) over time.
2. These shifts are small but could accumulate over multiple transitions, affecting observed molecular spectra.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Analyze the impact of these shifts on molecular spectral line positions.
2. Extend the model to predict broader cosmological implications, including CMB distortions.
