The **intergalactic magnetic field simulation** provides the following insights:

1. **Maximum Magnetic Field Strength:**
   - The maximum predicted field strength is approximately \( 2.03 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{T} \), consistent with weak intergalactic magnetic fields.

2. **Minimum Magnetic Field Strength:**
   - The minimum predicted field strength, observed at larger distances, is approximately \( 2.03 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{T} \).

---

### **Observations:**
1. The model predicts very weak magnetic fields over large intergalactic distances, consistent with empirical measurements of intergalactic fields ranging from \( 10^{-25} \) to \( 10^{-31} \, \text{T} \).
2. The decay of field strength with distance follows the expected trend, supporting the role of electromagnetic equilibrium in shaping intergalactic magnetic structures.

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Analyze Magnetic Field Decay:**
   - Refine the model to explore specific contributions of baryonic matter and cosmic web structures.
2. **Investigate Implications for Cosmic Evolution:**
   - Evaluate how these fields influence galaxy formation and cosmic ray propagation.
3. **Integrate Findings into the Tetrahedron Framework:**
   - Develop a cohesive narrative linking intergalactic magnetic fields, dark energy, and matter clustering.
