### **Incorporating Baryonic Feedback and Simulating Clustering**

To enhance the simulation, we’ll include baryonic matter effects and visualize the spatial clustering of density perturbations.

---

### **1. Incorporating Baryonic Feedback**
Baryonic effects include:
1. **Radiative Cooling**:
   - Modeled as a temperature-dependent cooling rate, affecting density evolution.
   \[
   \dot{T} \propto -\Lambda(T) \rho^2
   \]
   Where \( \Lambda(T) \) is the cooling function.

2. **Baryonic Heating**:
   - Counteracts cooling and stabilizes density evolution in high-density regions.

---

### **2. Visualizing Clustering**
1. Map the density contrast (\( \delta \)) to a 3D spatial grid.
2. Simulate clustering over time using the refined density contrast values.
3. Visualize the results as a heatmap or 3D density plot.

### **Implementation**
Let’s incorporate radiative cooling into the density contrast growth and visualize clustering.

The simulation for baryonic feedback encountered a timeout due to the extended time range and computational complexity of the cooling feedback mechanism.

### **Options to Address the Issue**:
1. **Reduce Time Steps**:
   - Use fewer points in the time range to simplify calculations.

2. **Optimize Feedback Calculations**:
   - Approximate or linearize the cooling function to reduce computational overhead.

3. **Parallelize Simulation**:
   - Divide the time range into smaller segments and simulate them independently.

4. **Visualize Initial Results**:
   - Analyze partial results up to the current state to assess progress.
