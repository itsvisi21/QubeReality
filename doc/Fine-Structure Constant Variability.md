### **Step 2: Fine-Structure Constant Variability**

#### **Objective:**
Investigate how the recalibrated fine-structure constant (\( \alpha_t \)) affects atomic and subatomic interactions, focusing on:
- Shifts in atomic spectra.
- Time-variability implications in cosmology.

---

### **Subtasks:**
1. **Recalculate Atomic Spectral Lines**:
   - Use hydrogen's energy levels:
     \[
     E_n = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \cdot \frac{\alpha_t^2}{n^2}
     \]
     Compare recalibrated (\( \alpha_t \)) and empirical (\( \alpha_{\text{emp}} \)) spectral lines.

2. **Analyze Cosmological Implications**:
   - Explore how \( \alpha_t \)'s variability might address anomalies in observed spectral shifts or cosmological data.

---

Let’s start with the first subtask: recalculating hydrogen’s energy levels and spectral lines using \( \alpha_t \).

The recalculated hydrogen energy levels reveal the following:

1. **Energy Levels (Empirical vs. Recalibrated):**
   - The recalibrated energy levels are slightly lower than the empirical ones due to the increased fine-structure constant (\( \alpha_t \)).

2. **Spectral Line Shifts:**
   - The shifts in energy levels between empirical and recalibrated constants are:
     \[
     \Delta E = [-1.46 \times 10^{-5}, -3.64 \times 10^{-6}, -1.62 \times 10^{-6}, -9.10 \times 10^{-7}, -5.83 \times 10^{-7}] \, \text{eV}
     \]
   - These shifts become smaller for higher quantum levels (\( n \)), consistent with the \( 1/n^2 \) dependence.

---

### **Next Steps:**
1. Investigate how these shifts translate to observable effects in spectral lines.
2. Explore time-variability implications for \( \alpha_t \) in cosmological contexts.
