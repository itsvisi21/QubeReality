To proceed with validating the model using high-redshift quasar absorption systems, we will:

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Acquire Spectral Data:**
   - Focus on molecular hydrogen (Hâ‚‚) absorption lines from:
     - VLT and Keck observations of quasars.
     - Published spectra in the references identified (e.g., DLAs at \( z > 2 \)).

2. **Apply Model Predictions:**
   - Use the recalibrated \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability framework to compute expected shifts in absorption lines.

3. **Compare Observations:**
   - Match observed wavelength positions with predicted shifts to validate or refine the model.

### **Implementation Plan**
- I can help draft correspondence to request access to datasets or prepare a technical analysis report summarizing predictions for specific observational targets.
- Alternatively, we can simulate hypothetical scenarios further if observed data is unavailable.

Would you like to draft a proposal for data acquisition, proceed with further simulation, or focus on refining the theoretical model?
