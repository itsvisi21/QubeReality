Here are the observations from the electromagnetic energy density simulation under the tetrahedron framework:

---

### **1. Energy Equilibrium Behavior**
- The total energy density (\( u_{\text{EM}} \)) shows a clear additive relationship between the electric (\( u_E \)) and magnetic (\( u_B \)) components.
- This reflects the balance required for energy equilibrium within the tetrahedron framework, where electromagnetic fields are not isolated but dynamically contribute to maintaining stability.

---

### **2. Electric Energy Dominance**
- At higher electric field strengths (\( E \)), the electric energy density (\( u_E \)) significantly dominates over the magnetic energy density (\( u_B \)).
- **Implication:** In systems where electric field strengths are large relative to magnetic fields, the tetrahedron model predicts that electromagnetic interactions are heavily influenced by electric field contributions.

---

### **3. Magnetic Energy Contribution**
- At lower electric field strengths, magnetic energy density (\( u_B \)) contributes more prominently to the total energy density.
- **Implication:** Magnetic fields become critical in maintaining energy equilibrium when electric fields are weaker, indicating a complementary relationship between \( E \) and \( B \).

---

### **4. Smooth Transition Between Components**
- The total energy density (\( u_{\text{EM}} \)) smoothly transitions as \( u_E \) and \( u_B \) vary, confirming the stability of the equilibrium model.
- **Implication:** This supports the hypothesis that the tetrahedron unit operates as a self-regulating system where energy flows are balanced across its components.

---

### **5. Sensitivity to Magnetic Permeability (\( \mu_{0t} \))**
- The magnetic energy density (\( u_B \)) is highly sensitive to the redefined magnetic permeability (\( \mu_{0t} \)).
- **Implication:** Small changes in the tetrahedron’s geometry or vertex polarity could significantly alter the system's magnetic interactions, offering a mechanism for tuning energy equilibrium.

---

### **6. Applicability to Larger Scales**
- The additive nature of \( u_E \) and \( u_B \) suggests that this model could scale up to predict electromagnetic energy densities in larger systems, such as cosmic magnetic fields or dark energy phenomena.

---

### **Potential Applications**
1. **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):**
   - The model provides a framework for reinterpreting electromagnetic energy densities at small scales, such as inside atoms or during photon interactions.
2. **Astrophysical Phenomena:**
   - The balance between \( u_E \) and \( u_B \) could explain magnetic field generation in stars and galaxies, as well as the dynamics of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
3. **Dark Energy Exploration:**
   - The model’s sensitivity to geometric parameters offers a novel way to explore how electromagnetic interactions contribute to the universe's expansion.
