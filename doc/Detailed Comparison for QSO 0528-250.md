3. **Keck Observatory / High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES):**
   - The Keck Observatory's HIRES instrument has been employed to study molecular absorption lines in quasar spectra, providing high-resolution data essential for precise wavelength comparisons.

4. **Research Publications:**
   - Studies such as "Molecular hydrogen absorption systems in Sloan Digital Sky Survey" provide analyses of H₂ absorption systems identified in SDSS data, offering valuable information for comparison. 

**Next Steps:**
