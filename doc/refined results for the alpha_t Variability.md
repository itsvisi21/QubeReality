The refined results for the \( n=2 \rightarrow n=1 \) transition with a smaller adjustment to \( \alpha_t \) (0.01% increase) are:

1. **Empirical Wavelength**: \( 2,282,981.24 \, \text{nm} \).
2. **Recalibrated Wavelength**: \( 2,282,524.71 \, \text{nm} \).
3. **Wavelength Shift**: \( -456.53 \, \text{nm} \) (blue shift).

---

### **Observations**:
1. The refined adjustment reduces the wavelength shift significantly, though it is still larger than the precision of modern spectroscopy (typically \( \sim 0.01 \, \text{nm} \)).
2. The recalibration highlights how small changes in \( \alpha_t \) can produce measurable effects, particularly in high-precision measurements.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Further refine \( \alpha_t \) to explore shifts within observable limits.
2. Analyze how such shifts influence cosmological observations (e.g., time-variability of \( \alpha_t \)).
