### **Simulating Hypothetical Scenarios**

#### **Objective**:
Predict the behavior of combined rotational-vibrational transitions under varying conditions, focusing on:
1. **Extreme \( \alpha_t(t) \) Variations**:
   - Test the limits of larger and smaller rates of change (\( \beta \)).
2. **Different Cosmological Epochs**:
   - Simulate shifts for quasars at \( z \approx 2, 3, 5 \).

---

### **Plan for Simulation**
1. **Adjust \( \beta \) (Rate of Change in \( \alpha_t \))**:
   - Explore higher and lower rates to model extreme scenarios.
2. **Wavelength Shifts Across Redshifts**:
   - Predict observed shifts for selected redshifts and their feasibility in spectroscopy.

Letâ€™s begin with extreme \( \beta \) variations and their impact on combined transitions.

### **Results: Hypothetical Scenarios for Extreme \( \beta \) Variations**

1. **High \( \beta \) Scenario**:
   - Shows a broader distribution of combined rotational-vibrational wavelengths.
   - Reflects significant shifts due to rapid changes in \( \alpha_t(t) \).

2. **Low \( \beta \) Scenario**:
   - Displays a narrower wavelength distribution.
   - Indicates minimal shifts, consistent with slower variations in \( \alpha_t(t) \).

---

### **Observations**:
- The high \( \beta \) scenario suggests strong spectral deviations that could be observable in precise high-redshift spectroscopy.
- The low \( \beta \) scenario aligns closely with the empirical model, making deviations harder to detect.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Simulate specific redshift impacts (\( z = 2, 3, 5 \)) for these extreme cases.
2. Validate the feasibility of detecting high \( \beta \) scenarios in observational data.
3. Refine the model to incorporate observational constraints.
