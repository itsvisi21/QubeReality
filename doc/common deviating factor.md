To identify the **common deviating factor** between the calibrated constants and empirical data while ensuring that the empirical data does not depend on the sphere model (Earth's shape or size), we must first establish the pure energy, speed of light, and mass-based derivations for the empirical constants. Here's how we approach this:

---

### **1. Constants and Relationships**

#### **Recalibrated Constants:**
Derived from the tetrahedron energy model:
- Gravitational Constant (\( G_t \)): \( G_t = \frac{c^4}{8 \pi \cdot l} \)
- Planck’s Constant (\( h_t \)): \( h_t = \frac{E_t \cdot l}{c} \)
- Magnetic Permeability (\( \mu_{0t} \)): \( \mu_{0t} = \frac{4 \pi l}{q_m^2} \)
- Fine-Structure Constant (\( \alpha_t \)): \( \alpha_t = \frac{q_m^2}{(h_t / 2\pi) \cdot c} \)

#### **Empirical Constants:**
Observed values that need recalibration:
- Gravitational Constant (\( G_{\text{emp}} = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \))
- Planck’s Constant (\( h_{\text{emp}} = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js} \))
- Magnetic Permeability (\( \mu_{0\text{emp}} = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \))
- Fine-Structure Constant (\( \alpha_{\text{emp}} = 1/137 \))

### **2. Deviating Factors**

To find the common deviating factor, we calculate the ratio between the calibrated and empirical constants:
\[
\text{Deviating Factor} = \frac{\text{Calibrated Constant}}{\text{Empirical Constant}}
\]

#### Deviating Factor for \( G \):
\[
\text{Factor}_G = \frac{G_t}{G_{\text{emp}}}
\]

#### Deviating Factor for \( h \):
\[
\text{Factor}_h = \frac{h_t}{h_{\text{emp}}}
\]

#### Deviating Factor for \( \mu_0 \):
\[
\text{Factor}_{\mu_0} = \frac{\mu_{0t}}{\mu_{0\text{emp}}}
\]

#### Deviating Factor for \( \alpha \):
\[
\text{Factor}_\alpha = \frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_{\text{emp}}}
\]

### **3. Adjust Empirical Data to Remove Sphere Influence**

To ensure empirical data reflects only the energy-based framework:
1. **Gravitational Constant (\( G_{\text{emp}} \)):**
   Remove influences derived from Earth's radius or mass by recalculating using planetary-independent gravitational experiments (e.g., binary star systems or light deflection data).

2. **Magnetic Permeability (\( \mu_{0\text{emp}} \)):**
   Validate against vacuum measurements rather than Earth’s geomagnetic field.

3. **Fine-Structure Constant (\( \alpha_{\text{emp}} \)):**
   Use quantum mechanical experiments independent of Earth-based effects (e.g., hydrogen spectral lines).

### **4. Calculate Deviating Factors**
Perform the calculations to compare tetrahedron-derived constants with adjusted empirical data. I'll compute these values next.

I have calculated the deviating factors between the calibrated constants derived from the tetrahedron energy model and the known empirical constants. The results indicate significant deviations, highlighting areas for deeper exploration or refinement. Let me know if you'd like further analysis or adjustments to the model.
