### **Analyzing Molecular Spectral Shifts**

#### **Objective**:
Quantify how shifts in rotational energy levels due to \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability influence molecular spectral line positions.

---

### **Implementation Plan**:
1. **Calculate Transition Energies**:
   - For transitions between rotational levels (\( J \rightarrow J+1 \)):
     \[
     \Delta E = E_{J+1} - E_J
     \]

2. **Determine Wavelengths**:
   - Convert transition energies (\( \Delta E \)) into wavelengths (\( \lambda \)):
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{h \cdot c}{\Delta E}
     \]

3. **Compare Shifts**:
   - Compute differences in wavelengths (\( \Delta \lambda \)) between empirical and recalibrated energy levels.

Letâ€™s calculate and visualize these spectral shifts for H\(_2\) rotational transitions.

### **Results: Rotational Spectral Line Shifts**

1. **Empirical Wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{empirical}} \)):**
   - The wavelengths for rotational transitions (\( J \rightarrow J+1 \)) range from approximately \( 83,473 \, \text{nm} \) for \( J=0 \) to \( 16,694 \, \text{nm} \) for \( J=4 \).

2. **Recalibrated Wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{recalibrated}} \)):**
   - The recalibrated wavelengths (5 billion years ago) are slightly shorter, reflecting the increase in \( \alpha_t(t) \).

3. **Wavelength Shifts (\( \Delta \lambda \)):**
   - Shifts range from \( -415.34 \, \text{nm} \) for \( J=0 \) to \( -83.07 \, \text{nm} \) for \( J=4 \), indicating consistent blue shifts across transitions.

---

### **Observations**:
1. The shifts are measurable and could potentially be observed in high-precision molecular spectroscopy.
2. Larger shifts occur for lower rotational transitions (\( J=0 \rightarrow J=1 \)), while higher \( J \) transitions show smaller shifts.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. Validate these shifts against observed molecular spectra (e.g., from interstellar clouds or quasar absorption lines).
2. Extend the analysis to predict shifts in vibrational transitions or other molecular species.
