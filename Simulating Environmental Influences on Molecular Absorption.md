### **Simulating Environmental Influences on Molecular Absorption**

#### **Objective**:
Analyze how temperature, pressure, and density in interstellar clouds affect molecular transitions, focusing on CO and OH absorption features.

---

### **Parameters for Simulation**:

1. **Temperature (\( T \))**:
   - Range: \( 10 \, \text{K} \) (cold clouds) to \( 100 \, \text{K} \) (warm clouds).

2. **Pressure (\( P \))**:
   - Range: \( 10^{-12} \, \text{Pa} \) (diffuse clouds) to \( 10^{-9} \, \text{Pa} \) (denser regions).

3. **Density (\( n \))**:
   - Range: \( 10^2 \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) to \( 10^6 \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

4. **Rotational and Vibrational Transitions**:
   - Focus on rotational transitions for CO and OH.
   - Analyze shifts in energy levels and corresponding wavelengths.

---

### **Simulation Plan**:

1. Compute transition energies for varying \( T, P, \) and \( n \).
2. Calculate wavelength shifts due to environmental effects.
3. Visualize the impact on rotational and vibrational transitions.

Letâ€™s simulate and visualize these influences.

### **Simulation Results: Impact of Temperature on CO Rotational Transitions**

#### **Key Findings**:
1. **Transition Wavelengths**:
   - Wavelengths for rotational transitions (e.g., \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \), \( J = 1 \to J = 2 \)) range from \( 65,650 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 7,294 \, \text{nm} \) across temperature ranges (\( 10 \, \text{K} \) to \( 100 \, \text{K} \)).
   - These transitions fall primarily in the infrared region.

2. **Effect of Temperature**:
   - Transition wavelengths remain largely consistent across temperatures.
   - Higher temperatures marginally increase energy levels but do not significantly affect wavelength predictions for CO.

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Simulate Effects of Pressure and Density**:
   - Analyze how interstellar cloud conditions influence energy levels and wavelengths.
2. **Expand to Other Molecules**:
   - Include OH and other species to validate consistency across molecular systems.
