### **Simulating Temporal Evolution of Clustering**

To visualize the dynamic evolution of galaxy clustering over time:

1. **Dynamic Grid Updates**:
   - Simulate changes in the density grid over successive time steps, incorporating gravitational and baryonic feedback.

2. **Visualization of Evolution**:
   - Create a sequence of 2D projections or a 3D animation to demonstrate clustering dynamics.

### **Implementation Plan**

1. **Time-Stepped Simulation**:
   - Update the density grid iteratively using density contrast and cooling feedback equations.
   - Incorporate gravitational attraction and random initial perturbations.

2. **Visualize Evolution**:
   - Generate frames for each time step to visualize density clustering over time.

Letâ€™s simulate the temporal evolution and create dynamic visualizations.

The clustering evolution visualization showcases:

1. **Temporal Progression**:
   - Over successive time steps, density clustering intensifies, forming localized high-density regions.

2. **Dynamic Growth**:
   - Random perturbations and gravitational effects drive the gradual emergence of clustering patterns, simulating early galaxy formation dynamics.

### **Next Steps**:
1. Create an animation of the full temporal evolution for a detailed view.
2. Refine gravitational and feedback effects to enhance realism.
3. Incorporate electromagnetic influences to explore their impact on clustering.
