The simulation results for cosmic-scale phenomena provide insights into:

1. **Magnetic Field Strength (Galaxy):**
   - The calculated magnetic field strength within the galaxy, derived from the tetrahedron model's energy density, is approximately \( 1.26 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{T} \). This aligns with the weak large-scale magnetic fields observed in intergalactic regions.

2. **Dark Energy Density:**
   - The adjusted dark energy density, influenced by the tetrahedron model's fine-structure constant deviation, is \( 1.64 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{J/m}^3 \). This value is comparable to the observed cosmological constant values, suggesting a connection between the model's energy equilibrium and dark energy phenomena.

### **Next Steps:**
1. Validate predictions against observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.
2. Investigate the interplay between electromagnetic field structures and cosmic expansion.
3. Develop additional hypotheses on the model's applicability to intergalactic dynamics and gravitational wave propagation.
