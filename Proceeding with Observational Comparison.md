### **Proceeding with Observational Comparison**

#### **Objective**:
Match the refined wavelength predictions with observed molecular spectra from high-redshift systems, focusing on:

1. **Molecular Hydrogen (H₂) Lines**:
   - Known transitions from quasar absorption systems at \( z \approx 2, 3, 5 \).

2. **CO and Other Molecular Systems**:
   - High-resolution spectroscopic data for other molecular species in interstellar and quasar environments.

---

### **Plan for Comparison**:

1. **Identify Reference Observations**:
   - Use known datasets (e.g., VLT, Keck, or SDSS) for molecular spectra at selected redshifts.

2. **Align Predictions**:
   - Compare refined wavelengths (\( 2000 - 2212 \, \text{nm} \)) with observed transitions, considering redshift corrections:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{refined}} \times (1 + z)
     \]

3. **Validate Consistency**:
   - Evaluate agreement between predicted and observed shifts to confirm or refine the \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability model.

Let me search for specific datasets or observational papers that align with these criteria.

To align our refined wavelength predictions with observational data, we can consider several high-redshift quasar absorption systems where molecular hydrogen (H₂) has been detected. Here are some notable examples:

**QSO 0347-3819**  
A quasar at redshift \( z = 3.025 \) with detected H₂ absorption lines. High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed over 80 absorption features in the Lyman and Werner H₂ bands, providing valuable data for analysis.

**SDSS J1513+0352**  
A quasar at redshift \( z = 2.4636 \) exhibiting a diffuse molecular cloud with high column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen. This system offers insights into the physical conditions of the interstellar medium at high redshift.

**SDSS J001514+184212**  
A quasar at redshift \( z = 2.631 \) with observations indicating a multi-phase quasar outflow. Studies have detected molecular absorption features, including H₂, providing a basis for comparison with our model.

**QSO 0528-250**  
A quasar at redshift \( z = 2.811 \) known for its damped Lyman-alpha system with detected H₂ absorption lines. This system has been extensively studied for variations in fundamental constants.

**SDSS J082535.19+512706.3**  
A quasar at redshift \( z = 3.495596 \) exhibiting broad absorption lines. While specific molecular data may be limited, its high redshift makes it a candidate for further investigation.

These systems provide a basis for comparing our refined wavelength predictions with observed data, facilitating the validation or refinement of our model on the variability of the fine-structure constant over cosmological timescales.

By analyzing the absorption lines in these quasar spectra, we can assess the consistency of our predictions with empirical observations.

This approach will help us understand the potential variability of fundamental constants and the physical conditions in the early universe.
