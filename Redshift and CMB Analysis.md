### **Refining Predictions: Redshift and CMB Analysis**

To proceed, we will explore how the recalibrated framework influences redshift behavior and CMB anisotropies. The focus will be on:

1. **Redshift Behavior**:
   - Simulate the relationship between redshift (\( z \)) and distance (\( d \)) using the recalibrated Hubble constant (\( H_{0t} \)).
   - Compare with empirical data to identify deviations.

2. **CMB Anisotropies**:
   - Investigate how the electromagnetic equilibrium and dark energy density impact the distribution of CMB anisotropies.
   - Evaluate the consistency of the tetrahedron framework with observed angular power spectra.

---

### **Implementation Plan**
1. **Redshift Calculation**:
   - Define the relationship:
     \[
     z = \frac{d \cdot H_{0t}}{c}
     \]
   - Simulate redshift for various distances (\( d \)) and compare with empirical measurements.

2. **CMB Anisotropy Analysis**:
   - Model the impact of recalibrated constants on CMB power spectra.
   - Identify potential shifts in temperature fluctuations.

Let’s start with the redshift simulation and visualization.

The redshift simulation demonstrates the following:

1. **Recalibrated Redshift (\( z \)):**
   - The redshift predicted by the tetrahedron model is significantly higher, reaching approximately \( 4.25 \times 10^{14} \) for a distance of 1000 Mpc.

2. **Empirical Redshift (\( z \)):**
   - The observed redshift at the same distance is approximately \( 2.25 \times 10^{-4} \), consistent with current cosmological data.

3. **Deviation Factor:**
   - The recalibrated redshift deviates by a factor of \( 1.89 \times 10^{18} \), indicating an overestimation in the tetrahedron model’s impact on cosmic expansion.

---

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Analyze Deviation Origins:**
   - Investigate how adjustments to \( H_{0t} \), \( G_t \), or electromagnetic density could reduce the deviation.
2. **Simulate CMB Anisotropies:**
   - Model the angular power spectrum based on the recalibrated framework.
3. **Test Hypotheses:**
   - Explore whether hidden factors, such as unaccounted energy distributions or additional dimensions, contribute to the deviation.
