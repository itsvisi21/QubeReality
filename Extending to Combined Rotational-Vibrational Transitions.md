### **Extending to Combined Rotational-Vibrational Transitions**

#### **Objective**:
Analyze how \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability affects combined rotational-vibrational transitions in molecular spectra.

---

### **Implementation Plan**:
1. **Define Combined Transitions**:
   - Transition energy:
     \[
     \Delta E = \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} + \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}}
     \]

2. **Calculate Wavelength Shifts**:
   - Translate combined energy shifts into wavelengths:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{h \cdot c}{\Delta E}
     \]

3. **Compare Empirical and Recalibrated Values**:
   - Compute and visualize wavelength shifts for combined transitions.

---

Letâ€™s calculate and visualize these combined spectral shifts.

The error occurs because the number of vibrational transitions (\( v \to v+1 \)) does not match the number of rotational transitions (\( J \to J+1 \)). To calculate combined transitions, we need to align these datasets.

Let me adjust the calculation by pairing each vibrational transition with all rotational transitions to create a matrix of combined transitions.

### **Visualization of Combined Rotational-Vibrational Wavelength Shifts**

1. **Description**:
   - The heatmap displays the wavelength shifts (\( \Delta \lambda \)) for combined rotational-vibrational transitions.
   - The x-axis represents vibrational transitions (\( v \to v+1 \)), and the y-axis represents rotational transitions (\( J \to J+1 \)).

2. **Observations**:
   - Larger wavelength shifts occur for lower vibrational and rotational transitions.
   - Higher transitions exhibit smaller shifts, consistent with the diminishing influence of \( \alpha_t(t) \) variability.

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Interpret Results**:
   - Analyze the ranges of wavelength shifts for observational feasibility.
2. **Validation**:
   - Compare with known spectra of interstellar or quasar environments.
3. **Extend to Broader Molecules**:
   - Explore other diatomic or polyatomic molecules for similar patterns.
