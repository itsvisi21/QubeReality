### **Comparing Predicted Wavelengths with Observational Data**

#### **Objective**:
Align the predicted wavelength shifts for QSO 0528-250 (\( z = 2.811 \)) with available high-resolution molecular absorption spectra and evaluate consistency.

### **Steps**:

1. **Identify Observed Transitions**:
   - Focus on molecular hydrogen (H₂) absorption lines in the Lyman and Werner bands.
   - Example transitions include \( J = 0 \rightarrow J = 1 \) or \( v = 0 \rightarrow v = 1 \).

2. **Match Predicted Shifts**:
   - Use the range \( 7623 - 8431 \, \text{nm} \) to identify corresponding observed lines.
   - Compare redshift-adjusted predicted wavelengths with observed line positions.

3. **Validate and Refine**:
   - Assess the consistency of predicted and observed shifts.
   - Adjust the model (\( \beta, \alpha_t(t) \)) based on deviations.

Let me search for detailed observed spectra or databases for QSO 0528-250 to facilitate this comparison.

To compare our predicted wavelength shifts with observed data for QSO 0528−250 at redshift \( z = 2.811 \), we can utilize high-resolution spectroscopic studies that have analyzed molecular hydrogen (H₂) absorption lines in this quasar's spectrum.

**Key Observations:**

- **Molecular Hydrogen Absorption System at \( z_{\text{abs}} = 2.811 \):** Studies have analyzed the H₂ absorption system in the spectrum of QSO 0528−250, revealing detailed information about the intervening molecular cloud. 

- **Partial Coverage Effects:** Research indicates that the molecular cloud does not completely cover the background source, leading to residual flux at the bottom of saturated H₂ absorption lines. This partial coverage must be considered when comparing predicted and observed wavelengths. 

**Next Steps:**

1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtain high-resolution spectra of QSO 0528−250, focusing on the H₂ absorption lines around the predicted observed wavelength range of 7623–8431 nm.

2. **Model Application:** Apply our refined model to predict specific wavelength shifts for the observed transitions, considering the redshift and partial coverage effects.

3. **Comparison and Analysis:** Compare the predicted shifts with the observed wavelengths to assess the consistency of our model with empirical data.

By analyzing these observations, we can evaluate the validity of our model and its implications for the variability of the fine-structure constant over cosmological timescales.
