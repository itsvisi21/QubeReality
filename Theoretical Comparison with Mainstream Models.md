### **Comprehensive Analysis of Relativistic Dynamics**

#### **1. Introduction**
This report consolidates findings from simulations and analyses of relativistic dynamics, focusing on three domains:
- Orbital mechanics in the Earth-Moon-Sun system.
- High-energy environments such as accretion disks.
- Relativistic binary systems, exemplified by the Hulse-Taylor binary.

The goal is to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the proposed model compared to mainstream physics frameworks.

#### **2. Orbital Mechanics: Earth-Moon-Sun System**

##### **2.1 Findings**:
- **Orbital Stability**:
  - Earth’s orbit exhibits near-circular stability with an eccentricity of 0.00857, aligning closely with empirical values. However, the slight deviation suggests that while the model effectively captures primary orbital dynamics, minor forces such as solar radiation pressure or unmodeled perturbations may introduce discrepancies.
  - The Moon’s orbit shows high eccentricity (0.4735), indicating instability in multi-body dynamics. This suggests potential oversimplifications in the gravitational interactions or inaccuracies in representing the Earth’s tidal dissipation and the Sun’s perturbative effects on the Moon.
- **Energy Conservation**:
  - Energy variation remains within 0.03%, confirming robust conservation.
- **Precession Deviations**:
  - Simulated precession rates (−0.62°/year) deviate significantly from observed values (19°/year). This deviation highlights the need for incorporating refined models of tidal forces and additional perturbative effects that influence precession in the Earth-Moon-Sun system.
  - The overestimation in precession suggests missing tidal effects and inaccuracies in multi-body gravitational modeling.
- **Distance Change Overestimation**:
  - Distance change between Earth and Moon is exaggerated by orders of magnitude, potentially due to oversimplified tidal dissipation models.

##### **2.2 Recommendations**:
- Incorporate refined tidal dissipation models to account for energy redistribution.
- Enhance multi-body interaction algorithms, particularly for lunar dynamics.
- Introduce constraints to improve the precision of simulated Earth-Moon distance changes.
