### **Creating an Animation of Clustering Evolution**

To visualize the dynamic evolution of clustering more comprehensively, I will:

1. **Generate Animation**:
   - Create a time-lapse animation of the clustering evolution over the defined time steps.
   - Use the 2D projections already calculated for each time step.

2. **Enhance Visual Clarity**:
   - Add color gradients to highlight density peaks and voids.
   - Include a timestamp to track progression.
